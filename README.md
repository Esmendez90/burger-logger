## Description

Create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.


## Requirements 

Burger-logger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger under the 'burger ready!' list -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devoured!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the bottom list.
